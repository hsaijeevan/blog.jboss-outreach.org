for me i liked participation in Google Code-InGoogle Code-in because it will introduce us to open source and give you the opportunity to become part of the open source community by working on a real-world software project.

You'll be supported by an international community of volunteer mentors from our participating organizations to help you learn and succeed. You can ask questions and learn about all aspects of open source including programming, testing, code reviews, writing documentation, bugs, and even advertising.

Google Code-in is a gateway to learning new skills as well as learning the importance of collaborative and open software development.

At the end of the contest, you can show your friends, teachers, and family members the work you did on a public project used by thousands or even millions of people!

Also Prizes! Digital Certificates, T-Shirts, Hoodies, and a chance to win a trip to Google Headquarters in California!
